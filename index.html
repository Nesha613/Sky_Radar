        <!-- I think a fun idea to try would be to add a button that can the user clicks, which will kickstart the js/jquery code you have in app.js. 
        Eg look at the html example in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jquery-getjson-method/ 
        The function is linked to when the button with an id of #fetch is clicked, then it calls the method. So maybe something similar would work for yall here. Right now as soon as you open the app it will show you the temp immediately, which is fine but if you want an extra challenge then you can try the button. -->

    <!-- That's also why your js code isn't doing anything in the html. They're technically not linked, so I would say doing something like src='app.js'. This would at least mean the two files can communicate -->
    <!-- Also your js file is using jquery and is making api calls so you need to add 
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script> so that these calls are made successfull. I know I could've just added it in but where's the fun in that lol
